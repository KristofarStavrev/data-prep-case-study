# Data Preparation and Visualization Case Study

## Project Description

The idea for the project originates from an university class case study given by a private wealth managemen company. The main goal of the project was to create a way to measure key performance indicators of the company website activities using automated data cleaning and analysis techniques following the [CRISP-DM](https://www.the-modeling-agency.com/crisp-dm.pdf) methodology. The final results lead to gaining valuable insights about the customers of the company, helped steer marketing efforts to increase the visits and retention, and gained an overall competitive advantage.


The project was developed using R and R Markdown in RStudio.

Libraries used:
- stringr
