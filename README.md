# Data Preparation and Visualization Case Study

## Project Description

The idea for the project originates from an university class case study given by a private wealth managemen company. The main goal of the project was to create a way to measure key performance indicators of the company website activities using automated data cleaning and analysis techniques following the [CRISP-DM](https://www.the-modeling-agency.com/crisp-dm.pdf) methodology. The final results lead to gaining valuable insights about the customers of the company, helped steer marketing efforts to increase the visits and retention, and gained an overall competitive advantage.
